# Electric Vehicle Population Dashboard

This project provides a comprehensive dashboard to visualize the electric vehicle (EV) population based on a CSV dataset. The dashboard displays key insights about electric vehicles, including distribution by make, average electric range by model year, trend analysis of EV types over the years, and the distribution of different electric vehicle types.

## Features
- **EV Distribution by Make**: A bar chart displaying the number of electric vehicles for each make.
- **Average Electric Range by Model Year**: A line chart showing the average electric range of EVs across different model years.
- **Trend of Electric Vehicle Types by Year**: A line chart visualizing the trend of various electric vehicle types over the years.
- **Distribution of Electric Vehicle Types**: A pie chart showing the proportion of different electric vehicle types.

## Data Source
The dashboard uses a CSV file containing data about electric vehicles, including the make, model year, electric range, and type of vehicle.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Chart.js**: For rendering interactive charts.
- **Material-UI**: For the UI components.
- **PapaParse**: For parsing the CSV data.
